3) This program is a "game" that has a camera pointed at the character which is a collection of 3d objects. The camera moves with the character as the character moves through the world. The game has an objective which is to visit all the corners of the map while being chased by rolling balls. If these balls touch you the game closes and displays a message saying the game is over. The balls move constantly towards the player ass their "attraction radius" is larger than the map is. If the character goes off the map it falls slower than the balls do, so it is possible to see the balls fall off the map as well. Once the objective of the game is complete it closes displaying a message saying that the player has won.
4) The program is run by compiling it then hitting run. The keys of use are w,a,s,d,shift+mouse, and the arrow keys. the movement keys for the character are the w,a,s,d while the camera movement keys are shift+mouse, and the arrow keys.
5) Ensure you have the correct dependencies and then just compile it.
6) I am not aware of any bugs currently.
